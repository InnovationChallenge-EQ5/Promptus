# PromptUS: Ensuring safe and effective Prompts

Did you know that global spending on digital transformation technologies and services is expected to reach around $4 trillion by 2027? (Source: [Statista,2024](https://www.statista.com/statistics/870924/worldwide-digital-transformation-market-size/)) This surge in digital investment is accompanied by significant growth in the adoption of AI technologies. By 2023, between 40% and 70% of organizations worldwide had integrated AI into their operations, and this trend is set to continue (Source: [Statista, 2024](https://www.statista.com/statistics/742993/worldwide-survey-corporate-disruptive-technology-adoption/)).
As of 2024, approximately 75% of people are using generative AI in their work, highlighting the rapid shift toward AI-powered tools. Furthermore, nearly half (46%) of those users have started utilizing AI within the last six months (Source: [Statista, 2024](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1482102/rate-of-generative-ai-utilization-globally/)).

Among these advancements, the use of Generative Ai and Large Language Models (LLMs) stands out as a key factor driving transformation across various industries. The widespread adoption of LLMs is reshaping industries, driving innovation, and boosting competitiveness. However, to fully unlock their potential, it is crucial to craft accurate prompts while addressing safety and ethical concerns.

## Introducing our groundbreaking solution:

A system designed to optimize, validate, and enhance user prompts before they interact with AI, ensuring every interaction is safe, clear, and effective.

## The challenge:

As businesses rush to leverage LLMs, many struggle with poorly crafted prompts that result in inaccurate or harmful outputs. Common issues include grammatical errors, incomplete queries, unclear instructions, and the inclusion of sensitive or harmful language. These problems reduce the value derived from AI and increase associated risks.

## Our solution:

Our system harnesses the power of Azure AI services and Azure OpenAI's LLMs to create a comprehensive pre-processing layer for prompts. Here's how it works:

1. **Safety layer:**
   - **Content safety check:** Detects and flags harmful or sensitive language using advanced content safety algorithms.
   - **Moderation:** Ensures prompts comply with ethical guidelines.
   - **PII Protection:** Identifies and removes any personal identifiable information (PII) to safeguard user privacy.

2. **Improvement layer:**
   - **Decision maker:** Analyzes the prompt using the Role-Task-Context-Format (RTCF) framework to assess if it contains enough relevant information.
     - **If the prompt is adequate:**
       - **Reorganization and enhancement:** Techniques like reordering RTCF components, Chain of Thought, and Reasoning and Action (React) are used to refine the prompt.
     - **If the prompt is inadequate:**
       - **Clarification and completion:** Adds suggested text to improve clarity and completeness, ensuring alignment with the RTCF framework. May also use zero-shot, one-shot, or few-shot examples to provide context.

## The outcome:

The final output is a prompt that is not only safe and free from personal identifiable information but also optimized for clarity and effectiveness. This leads to more accurate, relevant, and actionable AI responses, improving overall interaction quality while ensuring ethical compliance.

In a rapidly digitizing world, our system is key to unlocking the full potential of LLMs while upholding ethical standards and optimizing prompt quality. Join us in transforming digital interactions for a safer, smarter future.
